# SS14 Bureaucracy Resources
**Documents and resources to help out with roleplay paperwork and forms in Space Station 14.** Inspired by Moomoobeef and Tyto.

As of now, this repo is oriented towards flair and decorative elements to use with your ingame documents, rather than actually 'usable' documents in a gameplay context.

These documents are made with Funky Station servers in mind, given that it's where I play most of the time. However, I will try my best to adapt to usage in other servers if it's necessary, along with game updates that might change anything.

If you have any suggestions, feel free to reach out on Discord: tunnel_master 

Most of these documents have been made using [this fantastic document editor](https://yagwog.github.io/RMC14-document-simu/).

Moomoobeef's forms are available [here](https://github.com/Moomoobeef/ss14-forms-txt).

Tyto's forms are available [here](https://github.com/TheTyto/SS14-Advanced-Paperwork).
