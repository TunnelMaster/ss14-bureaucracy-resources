As of now, these are a collection of job/role icons, fonts and assets for use in ingame papers.

All icons come in both a 6x6 (8x8 counting borders) and a 3x3 "grid" (not really an actual grid, but thinking of characters as pixels). They use the current ingame colors, and should be very easy to copy and paste into your own documents.

**5x5 Micro Font** is a .txt containing an entire font mainly based on the *Micro Chat* font by VEXED on itch.io. Every character is separated and currently does not include numbers. Every uppercase letter is restricted to a 5x5 space, which is not the case for lowercase letters (case on point, the lowercase i). **As of now, these characters will only work in monospace!**

**Role Icons - Full List (Part 1 and 2)** includes every role icon (plus Roboticist) except the ones exclusive to certain servers or forks, including antags. I've also made separate department versions for convenience, but the icons are the same as in the full document. Part 1 and 2 are separated because of ingame character limitations, though I recommend only using this document to prepare paperwork outside of the actual game.

**Role Icons - Goob Exclusive** includes the four CentComm jobs (BSO, IAA, Magistrate and NTR), Brigmedic, Roboticist, Blood Cult and Cosmic Cult.

**Role Icons - Frontier** includes all jobs present in Frontier Station servers, both old (Janitor, Cyborg...) and new.

**Role Icons - Funky 1 and 2** include all jobs present in Funky Station servers, along with their updated color schemes.

Other icons planned are:
- Icons from other servers: Frontier, Delta-V, RMC14...
- Other decorative icons.
