As of now, these are a collection of job/role icons for use in ingame papers.

All icons come in both a 6x6 (8x8 counting borders) and a 3x3 "grid" (not really an actual grid, but thinking of characters as pixels). They use the current ingame colors, and should be very easy to copy and paste into your own documents.

**Role Icons - Complete List** includes every role icon (plus Roboticist) except the ones exclusive to certain servers or forks, including antags. I've also split it into departments for convenience, but the icons are the same as in the full document. 

**Role Icons - Funky & Goob** include the four CentComm jobs (BSO, IAA, Magistrate and NTR), Brigmedic, Blood Cult and Cosmic Cult.

Other icons planned are:
- Icons from other servers: Frontier, Delta-V, RMC14...
- Other decorative icons.
