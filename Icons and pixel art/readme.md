As of now, these are a collection of job/role icons for use in ingame papers.

All icons come in both a 6x6 (8x8 counting borders) and a 3x3 "grid" (not really an actual grid, but thinking of characters as pixels). They use the current ingame colors, and should be very easy to copy and paste into your own documents.

**Role Icons - Full List (Part 1 and 2)** includes every role icon (plus Roboticist) except the ones exclusive to certain servers or forks, including antags. I've also made separate department versions for convenience, but the icons are the same as in the full document. Part 1 and 2 are separated because of ingame character limitations, though I recommend only using this document to prepare paperwork outside of the actual game.

**Role Icons - Funky 1 and 2** include all jobs present in Funky Station servers, along with their updated color schemes.

**Role Icons - Goob Exclusive** includes the four CentComm jobs (BSO, IAA, Magistrate and NTR), Brigmedic, Roboticist, Blood Cult and Cosmic Cult.

Other icons planned are:
- Icons from other servers: Frontier, Delta-V, RMC14...
- Other decorative icons.
- Fonts.
